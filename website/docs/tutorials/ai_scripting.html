	<h1>Tutorial for scripting AI</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			First of all I want to give some short explanation on the idea on which the current implementation is based.
			All the time-intensive algorithms like path-finding (and maybe some others which still have to be added) are
			done in C++. Everything else (!) is done within ruby.
		</p>
		<p>
			For simplicity and maybe security reasons, the AI code (like the level-scripting-code) is completely separated
			from the actual game code. So there is a strictly defined interface through which you can access your own heroes and
			gather information about the world and other entities.
