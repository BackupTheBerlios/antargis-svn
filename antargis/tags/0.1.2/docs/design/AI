Battles of Antargis - Artificial intelligence
==========================================
AI is needed for the enemy heroes (players).
There are one or more enemy players, which themselves have one or more heroes.

In ruby/ant_player.rb there is a foundation for these. There are/will be several different
types of player-classes.
A player responds to given events.

Current ideas for player-types are:
* lazy player
	- does nothing special, but responding to attacks (which is automatically done by AntBoss)
* conquering player
	- waits until an enemy is weak enough to attack him
* smart player
	- builds weapons, boats
	- then attacks player
