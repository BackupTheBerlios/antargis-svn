    <para>
      This manual page was written for the &debian; distribution
      because the original program does not have a manual page.

      <command>&dhpackage;</command> is a Level editor for the medieval
      realtime strategy Battles of Antargis.
      It is very easy to use.
      
      You can scroll over the map using drag'n'drop (with the left mouse).
       
      To upper the terrain just click on the button with the two arrows
      on the right and select a size.
      Then click on the terrain with the left mouse button to upper it 
      (create mountains etc).
      If you want to lower the terrain use the right mouse button.
      
      When you finished your work on the terrain click on the tree-button
      and place your trees, buildings and finally your units on the map.
      
      Than save the file and copy it to /usr/share/antargis/data/levels/.
      To load your map start the game and click on 'Single map', 
      than select your map in the menu.
      
      TIP: Sometimes you have to wait one or two seconds until your changes 
      take part, even on a fast computer, so just wait some seconds and check
      your processor load. If it is very low click again, if not than eigher
      antargis is crashed or you have to wait a bit longer.
