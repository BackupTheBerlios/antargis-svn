	<h1>On creating a campaign</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This is a short essay on what's expected within a RTS-game's campaign. This is not professional thing - just some
		thought of mine. But I think they should be considered when planning a good campaign. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider this as some ideas and if you have any ideas how this document can be improved. Write it down and send it to me. I will
		include it.
	</p>
	<h2>Guidelines</h2>
	<p>
		Here are some ideas about creating good campaigns for a RTS-game in general. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h3>Geography</h3>
			<p>
				Before starting a campaign the country-side, some cities or villages should be thougt of and named.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>People</h3>
			<p>
				Important people that will have some appearance within a campaign should be introduced. What's really important here is
				that the player has to care for this characters. So these shouldn't be introduced at a too late stage of the game.
				Otherwise the player asks himself - who's this guy and why the xxxx shall I deal with this? 
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>
				The story must be reasonable - there's nothing more annoying than inconsistent storylines.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Varying gameplay</h3>
			<p>
				The actual gameplay must vary a little - otherwise it'll get boring even if there's an interesting story. Within standard RTS-games this
				may be a) build base, b) attack enemy with full force, c) spy &amp; conquer. As you can see this is not very varying. This is why BoA will
				try to include many different faces of the strategy genre. More on this can be found in the gameplay section.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Varying difficulty</h3>
			<p>
				The difficulty level must increase within a campaign. NO matter how difficult or easy it should be on a whole. You may include some easier parts as
				present for a fulfilled hard job. But on the whole the difficulty must increase. 
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Because BoA is no typical RTS-game, we have to deal with the specialties. If you're not yet familiar with BoA's gameplay or its
		specialties continue within the game-description.
