* List of project-parts and progress bar

* check if reachable before fetching !!! (in house) - or even better use heuristic for estimating distance in getNear(...)
* saving of new hljobs
* fix jobs some more
* what's wrong with pathfinding-test ???

Short Information:
Problems are marked by priority. L is for low, M for medium and H high.
In special cases it can be Very High (=VH).

==================================================

ARTS
==================================================

[Arts - Graphics - 3D]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] modify bakery a little (http://antargis.berlios.de/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=359#359)
[H] do bow animation

[H] oil tower
[M] team color
[M] animate hero, druid and smith
[M] some statue (monument) representing the whole village
    it can be clicked to get information about a whole village or attacking it???
[M] some more animals: cow, deer ??
[L] Mesh for pigeon
[L] improve meshes for trees, bushes, men
[L] animate wolf
[L] add meshes for fish
[L] add female meshes
[L] animated trees / falling trees

[Arts - Graphics - 2D]
------------------------------------------------------
[VL] tools-images: pick,axe, hark
[L] paint new portraits
[L] paint campaign-images


[Story]
------------------------------------------------------
[VL] Intro cutscene:
	- flashback on some victory-scene:
		- look own from some tower upon an army
		- look back from behind some warriors holding up some weapons
	- scene of betrayal - some dark person stands above some king (in a hall)
	- game begins
[L] druids:
	- use woods and lakes as holy places
	- druids must learn about 20 years
	

[Music]
------------------------------------------------------
[M] won and lost jingle


[[Development]]
==========================================================

[Segfaults]
------------------------------------------------------
None known.

[AI]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] heuristic compression for path-finding
[H] map-weighting based on min/max of surrounding


[Gui/View - GUI-library]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] fix texture-painting on GeForce - backgrounds are always black, but they should be transparent (like FPS-display)
[M] add texture-space-saving
[L] add Framebuffer objects for paint to texture. -- still buggy ????
[L] fix AGMenu*. This is broken, but not used ATM.
[L] rewrite AGEdit - without AGEditLines
		In AGEdit2 is a beginning of a rewrite. But it's a kind of crappy approach. AGEdit2 should
		be able to 
		1) render quickly 
		2) handle selections with mouse or SHIFT+CURSOR
		3) copy/paste
		4) insert images
[L] add drawGradients-batcher to AGPainter


[Graphics - 3d-engine]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] use AGGLWidget instead of GLApp - include generic AGApp


[H] game crashes when toggling fullscreen (in game) -- FIXED ???? CHECK ON WINDOWS
[H] try using GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW_ARB for dynamic vertexarrays and combine multiple meshes some how?
[M] add support for non-3d-texture-graphic cards
[M] increase picking speed => use kd-tree or bsp
[M] FBO without color-attachment ????
[M] make particle engine more generic and include shader-support
[L] check depth of view old=(1,100) new(1,20) or so - maybe better for PSMs.
		There is a problem, too when zoomed in, as it's the current default.
[L] check if TSM (trapezoidal shadow maps) are any good
[L] snow,rain which falls down. Maybe as a simple overlay?
[L] bushes, plants, high grass, flowers. Thats means there should be possibility to include
		several imposters into one mesh and render them effiently.
[L] Fog of war - overlay darkness/fog
[L] fix decals (use clamp-to-edge and original cells)
[L] include 3d-texture-scaling into AGGLTexture-constr.
[VL] seasons - snow,spring... Exchange or fade terrain textures.
[VL] make shadows work on other platforms too?

[Game - Game-engine and ruby-scripts]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] check translation scripts

[H] wolves should attack people

[H] continue buildingsite function => check if already claimed
[H] fetching in house (testai) - tries to go through water - maybe move fetching code to some common module

[H] fighting should proceed when already attacked while formating!
[H] check saving/loading of ll-jobs
[H] remove old texts from local_* files

[M] helping in houses

[M] solve translation problem with descriptions
[M] troops can't cross too steep terrain
[M] do building continuesly and not in steps (fetching, flattening and building)
[M] add info-bar about troops to inventory or main-view, while fighting (?)
[M] chase enemy when he's fleeing (a little and not too far)
[M] make finite state machine approach in entities more visible (?)
[M] move from AntHouse to AntBoss:describe men's health and morale when inspecting
[M] add fighting on boat
[M] save current job :-(  high-level and low-level
		low-level saving should be finished, but high-level makes some problems
[M] tough breath when hero suffers
[M] fishing (fishes)
[L] add all config-parameters to config-file when created - and comment them a little
[L] Trees and scenery shouldn't be represented as ruby-objects, it takes too long to mark them all!
[L] add formations
[L] add campaign-loading functionality to load-dialog in-game  TRICKY
		This is a real problem, because the current AGApplication is called by the campaign-code.
		So the AntApp must be finished and the surrounding campaign-code, too. After this the
		loaded campaign must be started.
[L] add aggression-leveling of non-hero bosses
[L] add wolf, fish, bird
[L] single games - add village generator to map generator
[L] single games - add some menu for options
[L] decrease morale on men when inventing and not resting

[VL] very bad situation => raise heroes with a new player (rebellion)
[VL] add females
[VL] story-telling:
	- browsing facility (scene=>number(person)=>text)

[Artificial Intelligence]
------------------------------------------------------
[L] computer-player only attacks when stock is used up

[Multiplayer]
------------------------------------------------------
[M] choosing/making player for multiplayer

[Scripting - Levels and campaigns]
------------------------------------------------------
[M] finish first level of birth-campaign
[M] add some single maps

[Editor]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] loading doesn't remove old entities
[H] remove load script when in editor
[H] add painting by dragging
[H] plain other terrain type
[M] add directory-selector to load- and save-dialog (only in editor)
[M] add erosion to map-generator
[L] Trigger definition
[L] cleanup gui - remove unused elements
[L] fix selecting group. When you switch the "tabs", the selected action should be changed, too

[Packaging / Building]
------------------------------------------------------
[L] installer for linux. maybe some autopackage or .debs?
