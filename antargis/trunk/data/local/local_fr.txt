I will not go any further! There are strangers out there. They don't seem friendly.;;

Greetings stranger! I am the druid.;;
These are dangerous times. Be watchful in these woods.;;
I think I have lost my memory.;;

Welcome to our small town! What is your name, boy?;;

Then he is surely the man, the druid mentioned.;;
What do you mean?;;
Nothing. You look like a brave young man to me.;;
If you promise to act wisely and defeat those men in the north, you can have some of my men.;;
Yes, these attacked my party - as much as this I remember.;;
Well, then recruit some of my men and defeat this group.;;
Don't forget to capture the keep, too!;;
Boy, why do you leave your place?;;
