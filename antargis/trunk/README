== Description

Battles of Antargis is a project to develop a real-time-strategy (RTS) game, which is a
mixture of 3 three games:
* Powermonger
* Settlers
* Warcraft

The main purpose of this game is conquering a medieval-like world. While doing so with your
hero(es) you meet friends and enemies. Enemies can be fought with your troopers that you can
arm with weapons and armour. In some cases you'll have to build these weapons or new buildings.

The deciding differences to normal RTS-games like Warcraft are:
* <tt>Story-bound</tt> - the game is strongly story-bound. So you will be told some story while playing the game and not only in between the different levels
* <tt>Only 2 unit-types</tt> - This game only provides 2 kinds of units: heroes and troopers. The latter are the normal people, which do their work and can be recruited by heroes. Each player has an avatar within the game. This one is the player himself. So if this avatar dies, the game (or the level) is lost. The player can however gain control over other heroes.
* <tt>Restricted control</tt> -  You can't control your troopers directly. You can assign jobs to your heroes. They will then automatically control their troopers.

== Overview

The game is devided into several parts, which have each a specified purpose.
These parts are:
* a graphical-user-interface (GUI) library, which is called AntargisGUI
* a 3d-engine
* a c++-game-engine
* the actual game-logic in ruby
* much glue-code in ruby for menus, dialogs and the like
