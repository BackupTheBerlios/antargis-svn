== High level jobs
What high level jobs (further named as HLJobs) are or do:
* assigned to AntBoss objects only (heroes and buildings (or maybe Villages in future ?))
* organize all men that are assigned to this with low-level-jobs (LLJobs)
* each AntBoss can have only one HLJob at a time.

High level jobs are organized as state-machines. These state-machines are handled by BaseMachine.
A job-base-class (AntNewHLJob) is derived from that.
