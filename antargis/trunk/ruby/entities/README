== Entities 

=== Introduction

Entities are objects. There are many classes of entities, that have an entirely different behaviour.
But they have some simple things in common:
* each entity has an inventory (like in RP-games)
* each entity has properties like energy or experience - no matter how reasonable this may seem ATM.
* a low-level-job
* it can have one (or more) mesh(es)
* it has many different events, that are called, when certain things happen.

Because events and movements for every entity are computed in each frame of the game (should be at least 25 times a second), that's pretty much to do. Because Ruby isn't that fast, these things are done in C++.

So there is a basic entity-class in C++-code that's called AntEntity

Above this c++-class there is a Ruby-Class named AntRubyEntity, that contains some more basic stuff, that's implemented in Ruby more easily.
