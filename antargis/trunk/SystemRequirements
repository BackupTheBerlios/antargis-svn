These are the rules, which have to be implemented:
(Reasons to be found below)

1) Tiles have to be cubic with 5x5 control points.
2) Running speed is in half dependent on energy.











Reasons:
1) Reducing to quadratic splines does no effect, as we need 5x5 control points anyway. This is because at the corner points of each tile the tangent is needed, which must be derived
from the middle point of the next tile. Trying to reduce points per tile from 2 to 1 has no point, too, as the tiles in between have no control point at all then. This not enough freedom!
