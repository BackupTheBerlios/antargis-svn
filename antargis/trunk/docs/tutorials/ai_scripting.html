	<h1>Tutorial for scripting AI</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			First of all I want to give some short explanation on the idea on which the current implementation is based.
			All the time-intensive algorithms like path-finding (and maybe some others which still have to be added) are
			done in C++. Everything else (!) is done within ruby.
		</p>
		<p>
			For simplicity and maybe security reasons, the AI code (like the level-scripting-code) is completely separated
			from the actual game code. So there is a strictly defined interface through which you can access your own heroes and
			gather information about the world and other entities. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Scripting-API can be found at <a href="../ruby/files/ruby/ant_ai_interface_rb.html">AIInterface</a>. As stated there
			the current approach is devided into these parts:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>(BoA game-logic)</li>
			<li>AI scripting interface</li>
			<li>AI-conditions and AI-actions, which together build up the rules</li>
			<li>a derived class from AntBasicAI, that uses these rules</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			This is a pretty simple approach and should be exchanged with something better in the future - like strategies and so on.
			For a start we'll begin with this.
		</p>
	<h2>Building up a new AI</h2>
		<p>
			Ok, at first we want to have a look at the AntBasicAI-class. This is were we start from. Let's add our own AI.
		</p>
		<pre>
class AntMyAI&lt;AntBasicAI
	def eventHeroWithoutJob(hero)
		hero.moveTo(getSomePlace)
	end
	private
	def getSomePlace
		AGVector2.new(......)
	end
end
</pre>
		<p>
			Ok, this looks pretty complicated, but it isn't. We just derived a new class named <strong>AntMyAI</strong> from AntBasicAI and added
			an event-handler for the case any of our heroes has no job. In this case we want to send him somewhere. The position is
			not yet defined anyhow, because this should just be an example. What you can see here is that there are some event-handling functions pre-defined,
			like eventHeroWithoutJob, eventHeroAttacked - go to <a href="../ruby/classes/AntBasicAI.html">AntBasicAI</a> for more.
			On the other hand there are some actions you can assign to the given hero (here: moveTo). You can look up these actions in
			<a href="../ruby/classes/AIMyHero.html">AIMyHero</a>.  
		</p>
		<p>
			This approach is too simple to do a decent AI. So we'll have to get in some more abstraction. This is were the rules come into play.
			A rule is built up out of a condition and an action.
		</p>
		<pre>
class AIEveryNthCondition&lt;AICondition
	def initialize(nth)
		@nth=nth
		@v=0
	end
	def value(hero)
		@v+=1
		@v%=@nth
		return @v==0?1:0
	end
end
</pre>
		<p>
			A pretty dumb condition is this one. Every nth time it's called it's true. So the corresponding action is executed every nth time. A more reasonable
			condition is to check if the hero has enough food:
		</p>
		<pre>
class AIConditionFoodLow&lt;AICondition
	def value(hero)
		if hero.resources("food")&lt;5
			if hero.findNearResource("food").nil?
				if hero.resources("food")&lt;1
					return 1
				end
				return 0
			end
			return 1
		else
			return 0
		end
	end
end

</pre>
		<p>
			This already checks if there's any food in the vicinity. Ok, for now we're finished with conditions. Let's head on for actions. These are event simpler to do:
		</p>
<pre>
class AIRestAction&lt;AIAction
	def execute(hero)
		hero.rest(1)
	end
end
</pre>
		<p>
			This action lets the hero rest for about a second. This not quiet a decent thing to do, but it shows how simple actions are done. They're derived
			from AIAction and have to reimplement the execute function. Within this you can do a lot of things like finding an opponent for fighting.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we have some actions and conditions, we build up some rules of out them.
		</p>
<pre>
class AntAttackAI&lt;AntBasicAI
	def initialize(interface)
		super
		# add rules
		@rules=[]
		@rules.push(AIRule.new(AIEveryNthCondition.new(2),AIRestAction.new,interface))
		@rules.push(AIRule.new(AIConditionFoodLow.new,AIGatherFoodAction.new,interface))
		@rules.push(AIRule.new(AIEveryNthCondition.new(2),AIAttackAction.new,interface))
		@rules.push(AIRule.new(AICondition.new,AIRestAction.new,interface)) # dummy rule - always rest
	end

	def eventHeroWithoutJob(hero)
		@rules.each{|r|
			if r.value(hero)>0
				puts "GO"
				r.execute(hero)
				return
			end
		}
	end
end
</pre>
		<p>
			This example shows a pretty simple possibility for these rules. We build up an array out of 4 rules and each time eventHeroWithJob is called, they're
			checked from the first to the last. The first one with condition==1 will be applied. That's it for now with the current AI-implementation.
		</p>
 	<h3>Include your AI into a level</h3>
		<p>
			Let's assume you have painted a simple level and already placed and named some heroes. Let's further assume the (2) heroes are "Sepp" and "Depp".
			Normally you'd name the players after the heroes. But now we name them differently ("Seppel" and "Deppel") so you can see the differences. Go on and open the xml-level-file (.antvl). Somewhere in the file there is a tag like this: 
		</p>
<pre>
  &lt;antHero aggression="1" appearance="hero" birthday="-2049.1202086714" energy="1" exp="0" food="1" healSpeed="0.07" id="0" learnAmount="0.05" men="5" mode="" morale="1" name="Sepp" onGround="true" onWater="false"&gt;
    &lt;position x="176.315" y="164.746" z="1"/&gt;
    &lt;resource/&gt;
  &lt;/antHero&gt;
</pre>
		<p>
			As you can see the name of the hero is "Sepp". Now we add a human player that's named Seppel. Put this simply at the end of the XML-file. directly before the close-tag of antargisLevel.
		</p>
<pre>
  &lt;humanPlayer name="Seppel"&gt;
    &lt;hero name="Sepp"/&gt;
  &lt;/humanPlayer&gt;
</pre>
	Next thing you do is adding a entry for you new build AI, that's called AntMyAI.
<pre>
  &lt;antMyAI name="Deppel"&gt;
    &lt;hero name="Depp"/&gt;
  &lt;/antMyAI&gt;
&lt;/antargisLevel&gt;
</pre>
	Ok, that's it - go and test your AI.
