Coding styles are like this:
1) C++
	1.1) Simple Emacs-style indenting, with a new line for each "{" and "}"
	1.2) No tabs used here.
	1.3) Function go like "getPosition()".
	1.4) Classes are named as AGMyClass for everything that goes into antargisguilib
	1.5) Classes for Antargis are named AntMyClass
	1.6) Don't use globals if not necessary.
	1.7) Use getters/setters like "setPosition(xy)" and "getPosition() const"
	1.8) As used above use "const" where possible.
	1.9) Use doxygen for documentation and place documentation of member-function in .cc-files, so .hh doesn't get crowded
2) Ruby
	2.1) Indent with tab. I use tab-width=2 in Kate.
