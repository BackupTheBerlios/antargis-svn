	<h1>Battles of Antargis - Gameplay</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		It's been stated that BoA should be different - so I won't continue with this babble.
	</p>

	<h2>Basics</h2>
	<p>
		The basic idea of BoA is a RTS game. You are the player and have one or more heroes. The first hero
		is your avatar within the game. So if this hero dies you have lost the level (or campaign).
		Each hero can have troopers that will follow him. All of the troopers and heroes have their own inventory, health state, hunger
		and morale.
	</p>
	<p>
		Buildings produce different things like people, food, weapons. The heroes can fetch these things and use them on their way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your basic task is to finish level after level, be it a single game, a campaign or a multiplayer game. So we have 3 different kinds
		of games. Each of these games have similar game-play. But to make the gaming-experience good the underlying levels must be made
		with special care w.r.t. the chosen game type. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Entities within the game</h2>
	<p>
		Everything that's in the game-world is an entity. You can interact with nearly everything, but only through your heroes.
		So I'll give some short explanation about the things that are around.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each of these entities has its own inventory which can hold things like food, flour, swords, bows, boats and so on. Of course,
		it makes no sense that a tree has some boats. So there only some states really possible. 
	</p>

	<h2>Game goals</h2>

	<p>
		The gameplay includes pretty different tasks for the player:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Build base</strong><br>
			Build up some village with a working economy. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Conquer village</strong><br>
			Conquer a village to gain access to buildings or control over its people.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Defeat enemy hero</strong><br>
			Kill enemy, or defeat him alive, so he joins you and take over his troops.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Craft weapons or boats</strong><br>
			For getting stronger or become able to row over some water.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		However these tasks must differ throughout the campaigns.
	</p>
	<p>
		These different tasks can be used to fulfill your mission within each level. This brings up the question what the levels should look like.
		Wihtin each level there can be different tasks for the player to do, so that he gains some "bigger" goal. This goal might be of these: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>flee</li>
		<li>resist enemy</li>
		<li>defeat enemy (standard)</li>
		<li>build boats and get to other island</li>
		<li>find person</li>
		<li>spy on enemy</li>
		<li>bargaining with goods/men</li>

		<li>burn the woods (the crop, the buildings) of an enemy or kill all sheep to take his resources</li>
		<li>enemy has to put out fire and fight enemy simultaneously</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Crafting</h2>
	<p>
		Crafting can be done in workshops. If you have selected one of your workshops you can help within this workshop and 
		create weapons, armour and other things. 		
	</p>
	<p>
		People, who live in workshops (and other buildings) do build tools (and other things according to the type of the building) automatically.
		So for instance in a farm you can always come along and steal some food.  
	</p>

	<h2>Fighting</h2>
	<p>
		There are two kinds of fighting. The first one is fighting an enemy hero. An important feature of BoA is its aggression-handling.
		If your hero is aggressive he will kill all enemies if he's able to do so. If he's harmless he'll try to fight the enemy until he gives up.
		This may end in his death - so take care. If you defeat the enemy without killing him, he will join your force and you will be able to control him.
		In the case of his death, all remaining troopers will leave and go to the next building, where you can recruit them (if you've control over these buildings).
	</p>
	<p>
		Fighting enemy buildings is a little different. They will automatically defend themselves - but not alone. All buildings of a village will 
		oppose you in this case.
	</p>

	<h2>Defending</h2>
	<p>
		Villages have their own mind. So you're not able to control them in any way, but through recruiting their people with your heroes.
		If they're attacked, they will try to defend themselved. (This is currently done on a per building base - but this will be changed).
		If you attack a single building, you attack the whole village.   
	</p>

	<h2>Important note</h2>
	<p>
		This section is far from complete, so expect this to be completed in the next time. If you've questions ASK!
