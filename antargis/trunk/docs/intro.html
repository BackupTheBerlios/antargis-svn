<h1>Battles of Antargis - Documentation</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Because this a bigger project and splitted into a ruby and a c++-part,
this documentation contains several parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="api/html/index.html">C++  API-documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="ruby/index.html">Ruby API-documentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="tutorials/index.html">Tutorial section</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
For detailed information about the several file formats used, go to the tutorial-section.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>NOTE:</strong>The API-documentation is generated - so you have to run "rake doc" in your Antargis-directory to view them.
</p>

<h2>Game definition</h2>

<p>Battles of Antargis is a project to develop a real-time-strategy (RTS)
game, which is a mixture of 3 three games:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Powermonger</li>
  <li>Settlers</li>
  <li>Warcraft</li>
</ol>

<p>The main purpose of this game is conquering a medieval-like world. While
doing so with your hero(es) you meet friends and enemies. Enemies can be
fought with your troopers that you can arm with weapons and armour. In some
cases you'll have to build these weapons or new buildings. Another thing is
that resources are quiet rare.</p>

The deciding differences to normal RTS-games like Warcraft are: 
<ul>
<li><tt>Story-bound</tt> - the game is strongly story-bound. So you will be
told some story while playing the game and not only in between the
different levels

</li>
<li><tt>Only 2 unit-types</tt> - This game only provides 2 kinds of units:
heroes and troopers. The latter are the normal people, which do their work
and can be recruited by heroes. Each player has an avatar within the game.
This one is the player himself. So if this avatar dies, the game (or the
level) is lost. The player can however gain control over other heroes.

</li>
<li><tt>Restricted control</tt> - You can&#8217;t control your troopers
directly. You can assign jobs to your heroes. They will then automatically
control their troopers.

</li>
</ul>



<h2>Architectural overview</h2>

<p>As mentioned above Battles of Antargis is splitted into a c++ and a ruby
part. The advantage of this approach are the shorter development-cycles. It's
easier to restart a program after modifying some lines of ruby code instead
of having to compile the whole xxxx-load before doing so.</p>

<p>So much for the reasons. Here's the logical structure of the game from
bottom to the top:</p>
<ul>
  <li>C++ and libraries (OpenGL, libSDL, ...)<br>
  </li>
  <li>GUI-library named AntargisGUI</li>
  <li>3d-Engine</li>
  <li>Game-Engine</li>
  <li>Scripting-Interface to Ruby done with <a
    href="http://www.swig.org">swig</a>.</li>
  <li>plain game-logic done in Ruby</li>
  <li>scripting interfaces for AI and level-scripting</li>
  <li>AI and levels' scripts</li>
</ul>
