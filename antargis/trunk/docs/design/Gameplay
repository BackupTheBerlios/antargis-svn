Battles of Antargis - Gameplay document
=========================================

I Introduction
Battles of Antargis (BoA) was meant to be a Powermonger clone with a strong story line.
During development and some thinking it came appearant, that this was not good enough.
So some (more) changes to this very old gameplay shall be made.

Basic Ideas
a) Living world
The basic idea is a living world, that proceeds independently from your actions. There are animals
like fish,sheep, wolf and deer, that eat, walk and die. The normal population does its
occupations. A farmer grows crop and a craftsman builds tools.
b) Limited control
You have very limited control over your troops. You can only give your heroes direct commands, which then
command their minions automatically. If you have more than one hero, your main hero will send a carrier pigeon, 
that holds the command, to the selected one. So commands can be delayed.
c) Loyalty or morality
Each man has a morality value. If this goes to low, they desert. So you have to look after your people.
d) No unit building
As in a living world, you cannot create people out of nothing. You have to live to the people, animals and resources 
that are given to the level.
