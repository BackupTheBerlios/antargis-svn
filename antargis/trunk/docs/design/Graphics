Battles of Antargis - Graphics design
==========================================
There are several kinds of graphics for BoA:
1) "simple" 2D-graphics, as for
	- portraits for heroes; these are shown, whenever a hero speaks or in the upper right corner to display the heroes properties
	- campaign-images; maps, landscape views and small action scenes; these are shown between levels, telling some story
2) GUI-themes
3) Terrain-Textures
4) Static meshes
	- can be imported from OBJ-format using ./ruby/obj_import.rb
5) Animated meshes
	- can be imported from Milkshape-TXT format using ./ruby/anim_import4.rb
