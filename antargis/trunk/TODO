* Add coding conventions for ruby/c++ and ensure them!


[All]
==========================
[VH] CHECK FOR OLD TODOs


[Gui/View]
=================================================
[L] display for hunger/food

[Menu]
=================================================
[L] some images for the campaigns

[Graphics]
=================================================
[L] check depth of view old=(1,100) new(1,20) or so - maybe better for PSMs
[L] check if TSM (trapezoidal shadow maps) are any good
[L] support different grass height and different earth colors (editor)
[L] snow,rain
[L] bushes, plants, high grass, flowers

[Game]
=================================================
[L] each man should have a name and an age
[VL] reasonable quadtree-usage
[L] computer-player only attacks when stock is used up
[L] story-telling:
	- uppopping windows (with image and text) / pause game
	- history function
	- browsing facility (scene=>number(person)=>text)
[L] man/heroes should die, lose energy when starving
[L] implement loyality
	a) too many fights => lower
	b) fight won => up !!
	c) enough food => up
	d) rest => up
	e) bad weather => lower
	
	f) if loyality if too low => some men desert and go to next HouseEntity (additional heroes raise a new player!)
[VL] very bad situation => raise heroes with a new player (rebellion)

[Editor]
=================================================
[L] Trigger definition

[Packaging]
=================================================
[L] installer for windows
[L] installer for linux
[M] common package for gui, antargis and tileset
[M] reasonable installing/generation-places of tiles

[Story]
=================================================
- main campaign:
	- flashback on some victory-scene:
		- look own from some tower upon an army
		- look back from behind some warriors holding up some weapons
	- scene of betrayal - some dark person stands above some king (in a hall)
	- game begins -
	- scene with some bodies lying around 

* story
  * Am Anfang kurzes Intro:
    * verschleierter Rückblick auf Powermonger (Thorn & Tisch); danach Auszug; am Schluß irgendein Sieg
  * DIFFERENT:
	* flashback on some victory-scene:
		- look down from some tower
		- look back from behind some warriors holding up a bloody dagger 
	* scene of betrayal - some dark person stands above some king

  * 1.scene of game: - broken carriage with some bodies around, at the one side there are still the attackers
	                   - you cannot go there, because they will slay you. text will appear only once.
  * 2.scene: 				 - some cave with a druid - maybe some little druid-house is also ok (which saves some implementation)



  
* scrolling-borders  
* Level-Unterstützung per ruby
* Editing mode: heightstep (+/-), radius (through buttons or so)
* saving/loading-dialog
* integrate winter/summer into AntargisMap
* Water-animation:
	- simply subdevide water/land-tiles into land and water, with land being truncated below the height of water - afterwards add water and land tiles.
* Lighting:
	- overlay tiles with black rectangles (alpha=0.3 or so), maybe align rectangles (or better quads, or even better 3 points per iso-border) along tiles. maybe even use blending alpha
	  from 0.3 to 0.8 or so 
	- this can also be used for fog of war
	- using stencil buffer
	- overwriting with texture decreases stencil (or sets it to 0)
	- overwriting with rectangle incs stencil (or sets it to 1), but only if stencil=0
	- feiern!!!!!!!!!
  - einfacher mit VertexColors, beim blitting!! wird auch nur da gemalt, wo es sein soll!
  
* fallende Bäume - einfach die Kontrollpunkte in Baum speichern, erst danach rendern, Kontrollpunkte drehen um Fußpunkt, dabei immer über 0-Ebene halten - so kollidiert der Baum auch mit Erde
