Short Information:
Problems are marked by priority. L is for low, M for medium and H high.
In special cases it can be Very High (=VH).


[General]
------------------------------------------------------
[VH] Add coding conventions for ruby/c++ and ensure them!

[Story]
------------------------------------------------------
[VL] Intro cutscene:
	- flashback on some victory-scene:
		- look own from some tower upon an army
		- look back from behind some warriors holding up some weapons
	- scene of betrayal - some dark person stands above some king (in a hall)
	- game begins

	- a cave for the druid


[[Development]]
==========================================================

[Segfaults]
------------------------------------------------------
[M] a segfault appears when profiling with ruby (./run --profile)
		couldn't find the problem yet. it's probably one of these problems:
		1) some GC-problem
		2) some ruby-error (?) within version 1.8.4
		workaround done: simply disable gc nearly all the time

[Gui/View - GUI-library]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] fix texture-painting on GeForce - backgrounds are always black, but they should be transparent (like FPS-display)
[M] add texture-space-saving
[L] add Framebuffer objects for paint to texture.
[L] fix AGMenu*. This is broken, but not used ATM.
[L] rewrite AGEdit - without AGEditLines
		In AGEdit2 is a beginning of a rewrite. But it's a kind of crappy approach. AGEdit2 should
		be able to 
		1) render quickly 
		2) handle selections with mouse or SHIFT+CURSOR
		3) copy/paste
		4) insert images
[L] add drawGradients-batcher to AGPainter


[Graphics - 3d-engine]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] try using GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW_ARB for dynamic vertexarrays and combine multiple meshes some how?
[H] editor crashes on exit when using FBOs
[H] increase picking speed
[M] FBO without color-attachment ????
[M] make particle engine more generic and include shader-support
[L] make shadows work on other platforms too?
[L] check depth of view old=(1,100) new(1,20) or so - maybe better for PSMs.
		There is a problem, too when zoomed in, as it's the current default.
[L] check if TSM (trapezoidal shadow maps) are any good
[L] snow,rain which falls down. Maybe as a simple overlay?
[L] bushes, plants, high grass, flowers. Thats means there should be possibility to include
		several imposters into one mesh and render them effiently.
[L] Fog of war - overlay darkness/fog
[L] fix decals (use clamp-to-edge and original cells)
[L] include 3d-texture-scaling into AGGLTexture-constr.
[VL] seasons - snow,spring... Exchange or fade terrain textures.

[Game - Game-engine and ruby-scripts]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] fighting should proceed when already attacked while formating!
[H] check saving/loading of ll-jobs
[H] remove old texts from local_* files
[H] add all config-parameters to config-file when created - and comment them a little
[H] game crashes when Rowen dies
[H] choosing/making player for multiplayer
[H] Rowen can cross water without boat
[H] Fire is always hearable - even when nobody is restign
[M] add info-bar about troops to inventory or main-view, while fighting (?)
[M] chase enemy when he's fleeing (a little and not too far)
[M] make finite state machine approach in entities more visible (?)
[M] Options not obvious Andreas
	Options are now grayed out, but maybe they should be hidden.
 
[M] add arrows in man-class
[H] decrease morale on men when inventing and not resting
[M] add swords/shields/bows and apply them when fighting
		sword and shield is ready.
[M] move from AntHouse to AntBoss:describe men's health and morale when inspecting
[M] add simple method for direct level choosing
[M] add fighting on boat
[M] F1..F7 keys for hero selection
[M] save current job :-(  high-level and low-level
		low-level saving should be finished, but high-level makes some problems
[M] tough breath when hero suffers / some info-box appearing
[M] fishing (fishes)
[M] add "special" actions?
[L] add formations
[L] add campaign-loading functionality to load-dialog in-game  TRICKY
		This is a real problem, because the current AGApplication is called by the campaign-code.
		So the AntApp must be finished and the surrounding campaign-code, too. After this the
		loaded campaign must be started.
[L] add females
[L] add aggression-leveling of non-hero bosses
[L] computer-player only attacks when stock is used up
[L] story-telling:
	- browsing facility (scene=>number(person)=>text)
[L] add wolf, fish, bird
[L] add experience points and function to appoint hero
[L] Option to invert mouse zoom 
 For me at least, it's the long way around. It's opposite to Blender and counter-intuitive for me (roll forward to zoom out?). But to Godrin it must be intuitive, of course (otherwise he wouldn't have coded it that way). Thus the option will have to be there somewhere.
[VL] very bad situation => raise heroes with a new player (rebellion)

[Scripting - Levels and campaigns]
------------------------------------------------------
[M] finish first level of birth-campaign
[M] add some single maps

[Editor]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] add directory-selector to load- and save-dialog (only in editor)
[H] add erosion to map-generator
[L] Trigger definition
[L] cleanup gui - remove unused elements
[L] fix selecting group. When you switch the "tabs", the selected action should be changed, too

[Packaging / Building]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] windows version with many glAsserts for Andreas.
[L] installer for linux. maybe some autopackage or .debs?
[M] swig.* is not built automatically when headers are changed
