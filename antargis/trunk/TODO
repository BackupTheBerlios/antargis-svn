Short Information:
Problems are marked by priority. L is for low, M for medium and H high.
In special cases it can be Very High (=VH).


[General]
------------------------------------------------------
[VH] Add coding conventions for ruby/c++ and ensure them!

[Arts - Graphics - 3D]
------------------------------------------------------

[M] animate hero, druid and smith
[L] animate wolf
[L] add meshes for fish, pigeon

[Arts - Graphics - 2D]
------------------------------------------------------
[M] tools-images: pick,axe, hark
[M] weapon-images: bow
[L] paint new portraits
[L] paint campaign-images


[Story]
------------------------------------------------------
[VL] Intro cutscene:
	- flashback on some victory-scene:
		- look own from some tower upon an army
		- look back from behind some warriors holding up some weapons

[[Development]]
==========================================================

[Segfaults]
------------------------------------------------------
none ATM

[Gui/View]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] fix cut tooltips. There is a bug in AGEdit.
[L] add Framebuffer objects for paint to texture.
[L] fix AGMenu*. This is broken, but not used ATM.
[M] fix paint errors on text-elements (wrap-texture). Look at AGFontEngine::*.
		set Texture to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE or something like this.
[H] add campaign-loading functionality to load-dialog in-game  TRICKY
		This is a real problem, because the current AGApplication is called by the campaign-code.
		So the AntApp must be finished and the surrounding campaign-code, too. After this the
		loaded campaign must be started.
[L] rewrite AGEdit - without AGEditLines
		In AGEdit2 is a beginning of a rewrite. But it's a kind of crappy approach. AGEdit2 should
		be able to 
		1) render quickly 
		2) handle selections with mouse or SHIFT+CURSOR
		3) copy/paste
		4) insert images
[L] fix decals (use clamp-to-edge and original cells)


[Graphics]
------------------------------------------------------
[L] check depth of view old=(1,100) new(1,20) or so - maybe better for PSMs.
		There is a problem, too when zoomed in, as it's the current default.
[L] check if TSM (trapezoidal shadow maps) are any good
[L] snow,rain which falls down. Maybe as a simple overlay?
[L] bushes, plants, high grass, flowers. Thats means there should be possibility to include
		several imposters into one mesh and render them effiently.
[VL] seasons - snow,spring... Exchange or fade terrain textures.
[L] Fog of war - overlay darkness/fog
[L] animated trees / falling trees
