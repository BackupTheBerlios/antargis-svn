==========================================================

[Segfaults]
------------------------------------------------------
no segfaults known

[Gui/View - GUI-library]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] add memory checks for texture memory
[H] fix texture-painting on GeForce - backgrounds are always black, but they should be transparent (like FPS-display)
[M] fix paint errors on text-elements (wrap-texture). Look at AGFontEngine::*.
		set Texture to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE or something like this.
		this occures in intro when displaying text
[M] add texture-space-saving
[L] add Framebuffer objects for paint to texture.
[L] fix AGMenu*. This is broken, but not used ATM.
[L] rewrite AGEdit - without AGEditLines
		In AGEdit2 is a beginning of a rewrite. But it's a kind of crappy approach. AGEdit2 should
		be able to 
		1) render quickly 
		2) handle selections with mouse or SHIFT+CURSOR
		3) copy/paste
		4) insert images
[L] add drawGradients-batcher to AGPainter


[Graphics - 3d-engine]
------------------------------------------------------
[M] make particle engine more generic and include shader-support
[L] make shadows work on other platforms too?
[L] check depth of view old=(1,100) new(1,20) or so - maybe better for PSMs.
		There is a problem, too when zoomed in, as it's the current default.
[L] check if TSM (trapezoidal shadow maps) are any good
[L] snow,rain which falls down. Maybe as a simple overlay?
[L] bushes, plants, high grass, flowers. Thats means there should be possibility to include
		several imposters into one mesh and render them effiently.
[L] Fog of war - overlay darkness/fog
[L] fix decals (use clamp-to-edge and original cells)
[VL] seasons - snow,spring... Exchange or fade terrain textures.

[Game - Game-engine and ruby-scripts]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] rename farmstead to homestead
[H] rename inventing to constructing

[H] Add skip intro option
 You should be able to skip the intro - it gets boring 
 Solution: :Comment out lines 120 and 121 of /ruby/intro.rb to do this 
 Really, we should be checking command lines params before we even get this far, so you could do something like 'antargis --fullscreen --skip-intro' 
[H] Tutorial should be on the main page, not start campaign page 
 Got to make it easy for newbies - we all start somewhere! 
[H] Option to invert mouse zoom 
 For me at least, it's the long way around. It's opposite to Blender and counter-intuitive for me (roll forward to zoom out?). But to Godrin it must be intuitive, of course (otherwise he wouldn't have coded it that way). Thus the option will have to be there somewhere.
[H] Tutorial says to left click on map to move hero, it's actually a right click 
 This is a simple typo, although I feel left click is more natural. The solution is to change the text on line 9 of /data/local/local_de.txt 
[H] Hero doesn't really centre 
 When you click on the 'Godrin' icon, it re-centres the view so that the hero is in the centre of the physical screen/window, whereas it should really make it so that the hero is now at the centre of the map view area. Hope that makes sense. 
[H] Options not obvious 
 Options given on entity that are not valid should be not shown, or grayed out. I.e. if you click on a tree, the bar on the right hand side is updated, but it you cannot actually do anything with it at the moment. I think the icon should not be visible if you can't perform the action. 

[H] Quitting in game doesn't really quit
[H] add arrows in man-class
[H] decrease morale on men when inventing and not resting
[H] disable controls when telling story (after "come here my friend")
		this means you shouldn't be able to move your hero.
[H] add swords/shields/bows and apply them when fighting
		sword and shield is ready.
[H] describe men's health and morale when inspecting house
[M] add fighting on boat
[M] F1..F7 keys for hero selection
[M] save current job :-(  high-level and low-level
		low-level saving should be finished, but high-level makes some problems
[M] tough breath when hero suffers / some info-box appearing
[M] check aggression (fight) - enemies don't die when agg==3
[M] fishing (fishes)
[M] add "eat-action", "sleep-action" "special??"
[L] add campaign-loading functionality to load-dialog in-game  TRICKY
		This is a real problem, because the current AGApplication is called by the campaign-code.
		So the AntApp must be finished and the surrounding campaign-code, too. After this the
		loaded campaign must be started.
[L] add females
[L] add aggression-leveling of non-hero bosses
[L] computer-player only attacks when stock is used up
[L] story-telling:
	- history function
	- browsing facility (scene=>number(person)=>text)
[L] add wolf, fish, bird
[L] add experience points and function to appoint hero
[L] add formations
[VL] very bad situation => raise heroes with a new player (rebellion)

------------------------------------------------------
[M] finish first level of birth-campaign
[M] add some single maps

[Editor]
------------------------------------------------------
[L] Trigger definition
[L] cleanup gui - remove unused elements
[L] fix selecting group. When you switch the "tabs", the selected action should be changed, too

[Packaging / Building]
------------------------------------------------------
[L] installer for linux. maybe some autopackage or .debs?
[M] swig.* is not built automatically when headers are changed
