no segfaults known

[Gui/View]
------------------------------------------------------
[H] fix cut tooltips. There is a bug in AGEdit.
[L] add Framebuffer objects for paint to texture.
[L] fix AGMenu*. This is broken, but not used ATM.
[M] fix paint errors on text-elements (wrap-texture). Look at AGFontEngine::*.
		set Texture to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE or something like this.
[H] add campaign-loading functionality to load-dialog in-game  TRICKY
		This is a real problem, because the current AGApplication is called by the campaign-code.
		So the AntApp must be finished and the surrounding campaign-code, too. After this the
		loaded campaign must be started.
[L] rewrite AGEdit - without AGEditLines
		In AGEdit2 is a beginning of a rewrite. But it's a kind of crappy approach. AGEdit2 should
		be able to 
		1) render quickly 
		2) handle selections with mouse or SHIFT+CURSOR
		3) copy/paste
		4) insert images
[L] fix decals (use clamp-to-edge and original cells)

[L] check if TSM (trapezoidal shadow maps) are any good
[L] snow,rain which falls down. Maybe as a simple overlay?
[L] bushes, plants, high grass, flowers. Thats means there should be possibility to include
