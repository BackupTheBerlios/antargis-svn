== Overview
Rookey is a simplified build-system in the manner of the autotools based on rake.
It should make things much easier for c/++-developers wanting to create ruby-extensions.
But it can build your plain-C/C++ projects, too.

It uses swig for creation of the wrapping-code, but tries to handle the complicated
configuration itself, so you shouldn't have to care about it too much.

You're however free to hack beside it.

It handles the following things for you:
* dependencies of c++ and header files
* dependencies of swig-interface-files (.i), headerfiles and their derivants
* creation of the swig-interface-files
* directors and dynamic_casts are created automatically for children of AGRubyObject
* marking is simplified, so that you only have to override the "mark()"-method and call markObject(.) for each object that you want to mark (for all AGRubyObject-derived classes)
* Rookey takes care of the class-hierarchy and includes header-files in the correct order
* cross-platform compilation
* bundling packages/installers for different platforms
* (in future cross-compiler configuration)

Rookey is handled by a rake-alike syntax. Module Rookey describes how to use it.

link:files/examples/README.html contains several examples on how to use rookey. Apart from that have a look at the Antargis sources to get an impression of Rookey At Work.
