This directory contains the files for the base-functionality of client/server handling.
There are some common files, which are used by both the client and the server:

COMMON FILES:
 config.rb       # contains some definitions about protocol and ports
 messages.rb     # contains all the used message-types, that are sent and some additions to ruby's marshaling

CLIENT:
 client.rb       # this contains a simple threaded TCP-client, that encapsulates the threading and message passing
 ant_client.rb   # this one contains a simple login-process and gives control to the AntGameApp in antargis.rb after that

SERVER: (console only)
 basicserver.rb  # this one contains (like client.rb) a threaded TCP-server encapsulating threading and message passing
 server.rb       # contains functionality for a login-process and gives messages to the MultiPlayerMap-object (mpmap.rb)
 ant_server.rb   # This hold the application object of the server


This one is currently not used, because the ruby-marshalling is used for a start:
* mymarshal.rb
