== Overview

This part of the documentation deals with all the Ruby-parts, which contain:
* user interfaces like menus and dialogs
* basic game logic like maps, entities and jobs
* level-scripting
* AI-scripting
* multi-player support

== Entities
The basic objects of the game, like trees, people, buildings and so forth are called entities.
To read more about entities go here: link:files/ruby/entities/README.html

== Map
A map represents the complete world of BoA. It consists of:
* a height-map
* entities on the map
* some game-logic, that holds everything in place

To make things a little easier, it's implemented in several layers:
* C++-HeightMap
* C++-AntargisMap
