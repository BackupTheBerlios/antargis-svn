== Overview

This part of the documentation deals with all the Ruby-parts, which contain:
* user interfaces like menus and dialogs
* basic game logic like maps, entities and jobs
* level-scripting
* AI-scripting
* multi-player support

== Global structure
There are several different "applications" used when playing around with BoA.
* IntroApp - BoA always begins with an intro
* AntMenuApp - after the intro menus are displayed. There you can:: a) start a campaign, b) a single-map or c) load a game
* Campaign - in case you selected a campaign, this class manages the its flow
* AntGameApp - This class handles the actual game application.

=== Campaigns
* For more information about campaigns go ahead to Campaign.
* For single-maps *FIXME*

== BoA's world

=== Map
A map represents the complete world of BoA. It consists of:
* a height-map
* entities on the map
* some game-logic, that holds everything in place

To make things a little easier, it's implemented in several layers:
* C++-HeightMap
* C++-AntargisMap


=== Entities
The basic objects of the game, like trees, people, buildings and so forth are called entities.
To read more about entities go here: link:files/ruby/entities/README.html

=== Jobs
Each entity has a job, a low-level-job (LLJob) to be more specific. Certain entities additionally have high-level-jobs (HLJobs).
