== INSTALLATION of Battles of Antargis
Quick Start:

1) Install ruby, libsdl, libsdl-image, libsdl-ttf, libsdl-mixer, opengl. You need the developer-packages of all these libraries/programs! If you want to do serious developing you should install rant, too!

2) Don't forget to install ruby1.8-dev (or ruby1.9-dev if you use ruby 1.9)

3) After this step no root-privileges are needed.

4) If you have installed rant in step 1: Run "rant" in this directory. Otherwise: Run "ruby build.rb" in the current directory

5) Run "./antargis" in this directory

This game is mostly written in Ruby (www.ruby-lang.org) and C++. It uses Rant (Rant - Flexible, Ruby based make) as build system.
