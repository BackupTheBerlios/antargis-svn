== Antargis build-process

BoA's building bases on http://rant.rubyforge.org

It runs in two steps like most GPL-programs:
 > ./configure
 > rant

In future releases we might include installing, too:
 > rant install

== Configure

BoA's configure is totally independent of autotools - just in case in you might thought this.
Instead it uses some proprietary functions, that you'll find in link:files/build/configure_rb.html

The actual configure-script is thus written in Ruby, too.
