I've been working on this game for about 3 years and I think I've pushed it as far as I could alone.
So now it's time to seriously call for help.  I don't want to publish this as a full release but mearly as
a techdemo.

Project name:
Battles of Antargis

Short description:
This game is a real-time strategy which aims at conquering. The player isn't able to build units.
The approach is very similar to Bullfrog's Powermonger. But there will be strong story lines in the game similar
to Battle for Wesnoth. The license is GPL for the game and it's content; and LGPL for the built-in GUI-library.

Status:
The underlying engine is nearly complete but still needs some tweaking. I have started a tutorial and a first campaign.
The main issues are:
1) Lack of story, levels and maps
2) Lack of arts (2d and 3d)
3) object and level scripting (in Ruby)

A first tech-demo can be found at the Downloads-section.

I'm searching for:
1) all kind of artists: music, sound, 2d- and 3d-arts
2) level-designers and story-writers
3) developers with ruby and/or c++ experience
4) an "OpenGL-guru", who is able to optimize my current code.
5) some testers and people with ideas how to improve the gameplay.

Your invited to discuss the game at Antargis' forums!
