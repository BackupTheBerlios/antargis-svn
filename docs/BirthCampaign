!!A Hero Is Born

Discussion: nice name for our hero - shouldn't really be "Godrin".


Level 1: (partly finished in game)
* short intro to the story - no real fighting-level

* short monologue(?) describing that Godrin(?) and his party was attacked and that he doesn't really remember
* Player should be led east by sentences like "I don't want to go there, because..."
* in the west the attackers rest
* Player goes east and meets the druid. Druid tells something about the future "times of remembering" (but not in the meaning of Godrin's memory)
* Player goes west to the small village and meets Smith.
* Smith tells Godrin to recruit some of the people and defeat the enemy.
* Player tries to defeat enemies, but somehow they flee northwards. (to be discussed)

Level 2: (map hardly finished)
* defeat the enemy, no one should escape
* here is a tower, a house which are all not friendly
* you need to defeat the house and then the tower to defeat the enemy hero afterwards

Level 3: (not started)
* a messenger arrives that tells you, that word came through to the evil lord
* he has meanwhile killed the king and you must flee

Level 4:
* build a restistance
* defeat heroes and recruit them this way

Level 5:
* move to the hills to gather there

Level 6:
* attack evil king at last

Level 7:
* you have a traitor among your rebels
* he tries to take over - you must defeat him

Level 8:
* some of your former rebel-leaders want to be indenpendent
* choose what to do...
