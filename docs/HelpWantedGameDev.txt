Battles of Antargis is searching for help.
 
 
 <b>Team name:</b>
The Battles of Antargis team.
 
 <b>Project name:</b> 
Battles of Antargis.
 
 <b>Brief description:</b>
An open-source medieval realtime-strategy game. It includes its own game engine which is based upon libSDL and OpenGL.
We have just released the third official version (0.1.2). It's time to gather more help and
gain some speed.
 
<b>Target aim:</b>
This is and will be an open-source game. It's code and content is licensed under GPL.
Artists are however free to provide content under another compatible license, which would be some kind of Creative Commons License.
The GUI-library of the game is licensed under LGPL.
 
<b>Compensation:</b>
There will be no compensation whatsoever. This is just for fun and fame.
 
<b>Technology:</b>
Targetsystems are all we can cover. Currently it's Linux,Windows XP and FreeBSD - these are tested. But it's likely that it runs on MacOS X,Sun or whatever Unix-System, 
too, or it can at least be easily ported.

It depends mainly on OpenGL, libSDL (and descendants), the Ruby language and SWIG for interface building.
The engine and the GUI-library are written in C++. The game-logic is mainly implemented using Ruby.

<b>Talent needed:</b>
We need:
* all kind of artists (music, sound, 2d-images, 3d-models, story-writers and level-designers)
* developers

Artists can provide music, images and 3D-models.

For music we need some tunes, that match with a medieval game. Formats would be Ogg/Vorbis, which shouldn't be a problem at all.

2D-artists can provide images that will be displayed between single levels to tell the story and portraits of our heroes.

3D-artists can contribute by creating 3d-models, skinning, texturing and animation. We are relatively free on formats as we use OBJ-format, which
is supported by most programs. For animation currently only Milkshape-TXT-format is supported. Others can be added easily, but it's hardly necessary as Milkshape does
support so many. (<a href='http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/'>Milkshape 3D</a>)

For level-designers there exists a map-editor.

Developers will have a whole bunch of things to do. There is plenty work to do for the game-engine (C++), the game-logic (Ruby and C++) and level-scripting (Ruby).
Experiences with OOP are necessary. Ruby/C++ knowledge is recommended or needed. But remember, anything can be learnt!

<b>Team structure:</b>
I'm the current team leader and have done most of the development and artwork.
After an anouncement on the Linux Game Tome some weeks ago, we have already gathered some contributors.
But it would be nice to have some more!

<b>Additional Info:</b>
This game was planned as a Powermonger-clone. But Battles of Antargis shall outpace it.
The gameplay is like this:
You have one or more heroes that have some troops each. With these you fulfill different missions, like conquering everything or defending a map.
The difference to typical RTS games is the restricted control over your people. You can only control your heroes. The rest of your people have "their own" mind.
If they are dissatisfied, they will no longer support you.
For the first versions this game will be single-player with big emphasis on story. When a first campaign is finished we'll head for multiplayer.
